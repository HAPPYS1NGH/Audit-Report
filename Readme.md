# Audit Report for StorageVictim Contract

### Summary

The StorageVictim contract is a simple storage contract that allows users to store an amount in a mapping with their address as the key. The contract has a vulnerability that can lead to the storage of unintended data.

### Findings

1. Uninitialized Storage Pointer
   The store function has an unused, uninitialized Storage struct pointer. This can lead to unintended storage of data, as the struct will default to all zeros, which may be interpreted as valid data.

2. Owner Variable is Unnecessary
   The owner variable is not used in the contract, and its value is never changed. It can be safely removed from the contract without affecting its functionality or set to immutable if needed.

### Recommendations

1. Remove Unused, Uninitialized Pointer
   The unused, uninitialized Storage struct pointer in the store function should be removed from the contract to prevent unintended storage of data.

2. Remove Unnecessary Owner Variable
   The owner variable should be removed from the contract, as it is not used and has no impact on the contract's functionality.

3. Solidity Naming Convention
   \_amount in store is not in Mixed Case and not according to solidity naming convention.

### Conclusion

The StorageVictim contract is a simple contract with a vulnerability that can lead to unintended storage of data. However, the issue is easy to fix by removing the unused pointer and unnecessary variable.
